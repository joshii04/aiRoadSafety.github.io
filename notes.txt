Hi all, this is where we will be conducting our project for the AI Road Safety System. 

It is important that all of you read this before starting, as it will set some ground rules
on how this project development will work. 

All of you will be required to do the initial setup proccess of this project on your own devices,
as there may be some frameworks and libraries that you need to install. 

This is the video: https://youtu.be/UuNGmhLpbCI?si=KYlqBxHCnW78MsX5 

You are all required to develop a part of the video each, in the below fashion. There are 2 different 
methods for the building our system. These are two chapters on the youtube video that you just need to follow:

- 1. Image Classification with SciKit Learn (Aprox 30 mins of video time)
- 2. Image Classification with Yolo V8 (Aprox 45 mins of video time)

Basma + Achraf (1)
Jason + Zack (2)

I have created two separate brances for each team, so only pull and push to your designated branches for version control.
